To-Do List
==========

Features
--------

* wrap a little gui around this so non-devs can play
* add cool 'kill' effect (explosion, other)
* a little more variation in circle speed would be nice
* instead of killing circles and making them explode, maybe have them
  start falling back to the bottom when they're killed. players would
  have to finish before the first ball hits the top or bottom

Code Refactoring
----------------

* rename the classes and files to represent what this code became (it didn't start out to be a game)
* reconsider the actors/design (again, this didn't start out to become this game)
